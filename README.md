## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I'm a passionate software engineer from Pakistan 🇵🇰 with **4 years of experience** crafting exceptional user experiences and building scalable frontend solutions. My expertise lies in translating complex Figma designs into pixel-perfect, high-performing interfaces, optimizing API integrations, and leading teams toward successful project outcomes.

Lately, I'm expanding into applied AI — building LLM-integrations, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, agentic AI experiments, and practical prompt engineering for production-grade apps.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, solving real-world problems, mentoring junior developers, or contributing to open-source projects.

## 🤖 AI Projects & Experiments

- Agentic AI Playground — Personal experiments with multi-step agents (planner + executor + tool invocations). Repo: https://github.com/Usama-dev182/agentic-ai-playground (placeholder)  
- Prompt Engineering Playbook — Curated prompt templates and few-shot examples for intent steering, system messages, and safety prompts. Repo: https://github.com/Usama-dev182/prompt-playbook (placeholder)  
- RAG Documentation Search — A demo that ingests docs, creates embeddings, stores them in a vector DB, and serves a conversational UI. Repo: https://github.com/Usama-dev182/rag-docs-search (placeholder)  
- LLM Integrations & Frontend Patterns — Example apps demonstrating streaming completions, conversation state, and cost-optimized hybrid retrieval+generation.

(Links above are examples — I plan to create/pin these repositories so you can open them directly.)

## 🧭 AI Workflow (how I approach AI features)

1. Define the user goal and acceptance criteria (UX + safety).  
2. Collect & sanitize source data (documents, logs, APIs).  
3. Preprocess and split documents, compute embeddings.  
4. Store vectors in a vector DB (Pinecone / Weaviate / FAISS).  
5. Build retrieval layer and design prompt templates (RAG).  
6. Wire LLMs (OpenAI / Cohere / HF) with chain logic (LangChain/LlamaIndex).  
7. Add agentic components (planner, tool invoker, fallback rules) for multi-step tasks.  
8. Test with adversarial prompts, measure hallucination rates, tune retrieval.  
9. Monitor, log, and optimize cost/latency and add safety controls.  
10. Iterate with user feedback and metrics.

## ✍️ Prompt Engineering — Examples & Patterns

- System + User pattern:
  - System: "You are a concise assistant that cites sources and refuses unsafe requests."
  - User: "Summarize the updates in this document and list the top 3 action items."
- Chain-of-thought (structured):
  - "Step 1: Identify key facts. Step 2: Rank them by priority. Step 3: Output a short summary and actions."
- Few-shot for format:
  - Provide 2–3 examples of input → desired output to steer style and verbosity.

(Keep prompts short in production and rely on RAG to ground answers with citations.)

## 🔧 How I integrate RAG + LLMs (high level)

- Ingestion: chunk docs, compute embeddings with an embeddings model.  
- Vector store: Pinecone / Weaviate / FAISS (local) for nearest-neighbor retrieval.  
- Retriever: top-k results with filtering (metadata, time decay) for relevance.  
- Prompt assembly: include retrieved docs, system instruction, and user query.  
- LLM call: use temperature/cost tuning, streaming where beneficial.  
- Post-processing: extract citations, sanitize outputs, apply safety filters.
